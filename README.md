# How it was made: 
**Tech Used:** FIGMA, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

This is a simple static website that was designed using FIGMA and built using Javascript, Html and Css. I made the decision not to use any framework because i wanted the file to be as lightweight as possible. I also wanted the challenge of coding from scratch using Vanilla Javascript. 

# Optmizations

# Lessons Learned
responsiveness is something i learned while buidling this website. I made sure to make it responsive on most screen sizes. My next iteration of this design would be better file architecture that would respect the Separation of concerns (SoC) principle.
